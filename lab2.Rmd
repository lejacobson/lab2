# Packages

`install.packages("rjson")`. Do this in your console.

Load `rjson` with

# U.S. senators

## Data

The JSON data on US senators is available at 
https://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/role?current=true&role_type=senator. We will
read this in using a function from package `rjson`.

```{r}
json_file <- "https://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/role?current=true&role_type=senator"
senators <- fromJSON(paste(readLines(json_file), collapse = ""))
```


## Tasks

#### Task 1

Print the structure for the first senator, Lamar Alexander, in the list.
```{r}
print(str(senators[[2]][1]))
```


#### Task 2

Extract the birthday for each North Carolina senator.



#### Task 3

Write a loop that prints the twitter ID for each senator in the leadership, i.e.
where `leadership_title` is not null.
